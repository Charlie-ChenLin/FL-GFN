# Better Training of GFlowNets with Local Credit and Incomplete Trajectories

This repository is the implementation of [Better Training of GFlowNets with Local Credit and Incomplete Trajectories](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=beHp3L9KXc) in ICML 2023. This codebase is based on the open-source [gflownet](https://github.com/GFNOrg/gflownet) implementation, and please refer to that repo for more documentation.
